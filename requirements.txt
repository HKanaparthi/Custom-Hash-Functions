# Requirements for SimpleHash256 Custom Hash Function
# 
# This project has NO external dependencies by design!
# All cryptographic operations are implemented from scratch.
#
# Python Standard Library modules used:
# - No external packages required
#
# Minimum Python Version: 3.7+
#
# For testing and demonstration (all built-in):
# - random (standard library)
# - string (standard library)
# - time (standard library)
# - os (standard library)
# - sys (standard library)
# - hashlib (only used for comparison in demo, NOT in implementation)
#
# Installation:
# No installation needed! Just ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher.
#
# To verify Python version:
# python --version
#
# To run the project:
# python hash_function.py    # Basic demonstration
# python test_hash.py        # Run test suite
# python demo.py             # Interactive demo
